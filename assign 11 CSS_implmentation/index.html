    <h1><u>Why Use CSS ?</u></h1><br><br>
    <h2 class="highlight"> <i> CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and
            variations in display for
            different devices and screen sizes.CSS Solved a Big Problem
            HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:


            When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare
                for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every
                single page, became a long and expensive process.

                To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

                CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

                If you don't know what HTML is, we suggest that you read our HTML Tutorial.

                CSS Saves a Lot of Work!
                The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

                With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one
                file!
